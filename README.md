# SmartSave â€“ Personal Finance Mobile App with Predictive Artificial Intelligence

## ğŸ“Œ Project Overview
The **SmartSave** project aims to develop a cross-platform mobile application that helps users manage their personal finances intelligently.  
Through the analysis of financial habits and the use of artificial intelligence models, the app provides personalized recommendations to promote savings, reduce unnecessary expenses, and achieve specific financial goals.

This project was motivated by the lack of financial literacy and accessible tools for personal money management, especially among young people and adults with variable income.  
**SmartSave** seeks to fill this gap by offering an intuitive platform that assists users in making financial decisions based on reliable data and predictions.
